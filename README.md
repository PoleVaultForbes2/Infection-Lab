## üß™ Project Overview

This simulation models a Pok√©mon infection scenario involving **trainers**, **rangers**, and **Pok√©mon** on a 2D board. The goal is to simulate how Pok√©mon either become "caught" (converted into trainers or rangers) or escape to safety in a Pok√©Center.

Each time step of the simulation:
- **Humans (trainers and rangers)** move randomly.
- **Pok√©mon** attempt to reach the Pok√©Center.
- If a Pok√©mon is adjacent to an infected human or another infected Pok√©mon, it becomes infected.
- If a Pok√©mon reaches the Pok√©Center before being infected, it is safe.

## üß© How It Works

### üßë Humans (Trainers & Rangers)
- 8 total humans, first 4 are **trainers** (ID = 0), next 4 are **rangers** (ID = 1).
- Humans move randomly each time step.
- They infect any Pok√©mon adjacent to them.

### üêæ Pok√©mon
- Start randomly on the board (excluding Pok√©Center).
- Move each step in an attempt to reach the Pok√©Center.
- If they are adjacent to an infected entity (human or Pok√©mon), they are **converted** to the same type (trainer or ranger).
- If they reach the Pok√©Center while still uninfected, they are **safe** and cannot be infected.

### üè• Pok√©Center
- A special area on the board.
- Once a Pok√©mon enters it, it is considered **safe** and becomes inactive in the simulation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Board.cpp Summary

### `Board::run()`
- Initializes humans and Pok√©mon.
- Runs the main simulation loop for up to 60 time steps.
- Manages infection spread, movement, drawing, and output.

### `processInfection()`
- Checks adjacency between Pok√©mon and humans or other infected Pok√©mon.
- Infects (or "converts") Pok√©mon based on proximity.

### `allInfected()`
- Returns true when all Pok√©mon have either been caught or reached the Pok√©Center.

## üßÆ Stats Displayed Each Step

- Total Pok√©mon caught by Trainers
- Total Pok√©mon caught by Rangers
- Total Pok√©mon that reached the Pok√©Center
- Total Pok√©mon still free
- Current simulation time

## üèÜ Ending Condition

After 60 steps (or once all Pok√©mon are infected/safe), the winner is declared based on who caught the most Pok√©mon:
- **Trainer Victory**
- **Ranger Victory**
- **Pok√©mon Victory** if more escape than are caught

## üöß Notes

- Humans and Pok√©mon are stored as arrays of pointers.
- Board dimensions, human count, and Pok√©mon count are configurable.
- Uses `usleep()` to control the simulation's pacing.
- Requires `conio.h` for screen and cursor handling (platform-specific).
